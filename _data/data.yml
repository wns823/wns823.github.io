      Always thanks to my parents, sister, and friends (Dong-uk, Dong-O, Se-chan, Ha-ram, Seong-hun, Hyo-lim, Jae-won, Keun-tae, Jin-hyung, Geongyu, Yong-kyu). <br> <br>
      제가 SNS는 하지 않아서 제 개인 페이지를 통해 제 대학 생활 동안 제 주위 분들께 항상 감사했고, 죄송했던 점이 많았다고 말씀드리고 싶습니다. <br> 
      그리고 2021년에는 다들 건강하시고 실타래에 실이 술술 풀려나듯 하시는 일들 모두 잘되셨으면 좋겠습니다. <br>
      이 홈페이지는 나중에 저를 세일즈하려고 만든 페이지입니다. 아직 뭔가 해낸 게 없다 보니 그냥 보여드리기 부끄러운 부분이 많아서 학부 때 그나마 했던 것들을 올려봅니다. <br>
